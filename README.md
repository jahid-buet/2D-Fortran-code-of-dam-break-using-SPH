# 2D-Fortran-code-of-dam-break-using-SPH
This is a simple 2d fortran code of dam break using Smoothed particles hydrodynamics(SPH) numerical method.
To run the simulation one has to run the "Dam_break.exe" 
to modify the source code one has to recompile the source files in "Source" folder.the source files were compiled with ifort compiler.
